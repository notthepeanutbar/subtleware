# subtleware

A small collection of gentle, browser-based scripts that do their job quietly.

Each script is designed to solve situational problems — from reminders to client-side behaviors — without needing databases, servers, or overengineering.

## Current Scripts

### invoice-fadeout.js

This script gradually fades a website over 30 days if an invoice remains unpaid.
After 30 days, it displays a reminder message instead of the original content.

**How it works:**
- No database required
- Time-tracking is based on the current date and a hardcoded start date
- Fully client-side, just include it in your HTML

More subtleware to come.
