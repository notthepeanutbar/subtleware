# Fading Invoice Reminder Script

This script gently fades a webpage’s content over a set period (default 30 days) to signal an unpaid invoice. After the period, the page content is replaced by a polite message requesting payment.

## How it works

- Tracks days elapsed since a defined start date  
- Reduces page opacity daily  
- Shows a custom message when time expires

## Usage

1. Adjust the `startDate` in `fade.js` to your project’s invoice date.  
2. Include the script in your webpage or demo (`index.html`).  
3. Customize the fallback message if needed.

## Example message

> This website has faded due to an unpaid invoice.  
> To restore access, please settle your outstanding balance.  
> For questions or assistance, contact your developer.
